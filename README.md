[^2]: The [TOP Strategy guide](https://dev.to/theodinproject/becoming-a-top-success-story-mindset-3dp2) makes it clear to [focus on the point of the assignment](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Focus%20on%20the%20point%20of%20the%20assignment) and that [foundations isn't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Foundations%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20strong%20portfolio%20generator) so no point in wasting too much time here.
